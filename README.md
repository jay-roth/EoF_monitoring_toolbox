2. **Event Delineation**: Identify discreet events from continuous flow measurements  
3. **Load and Yield**: Event loading and yield calculations from continuous flow and timestamped composite WQ samples  
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Various parametric and non-parametric tests  
5. **Plotting**: Various plots to be generated from formatted data
